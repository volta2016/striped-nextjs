# Striped Landing Page | Next JS

Lading Page built with Next js framework of React,  
I worked with the UI of the educational programming platform [leonidasesteban.com](https://leonidasesteban.com/)
My idea is to bring this landing page to life with subtle animations and make the most of my css skills. Also to make components re usable.
